# SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (suds)
Using a pair of SR04 ultrasonic sensors to get distance measurements and print them to serial out.  If a sensor detects an object <25cm away, it prints "HELP"

I hooked up a couple of LEDs too, thinking that I could switch them on if something was detected <25cm away, but they just stay on constantly...

### Materials
