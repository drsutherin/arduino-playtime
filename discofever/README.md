# Disco Fever Project
Combining several of the ARDX  tutorials (i.e. LEDs in sequence, multicolor LED, and potentiometer), this project creates a sweet light show.  The individual LEDs light up in sequence, while the multicolor LED flashes different shades.  The speed of the flashing can be adjusted with the potentiometer.

### Materials
* 10 standard LEDs (pins 0-9)
* 1 multicolor LED (pins 10-12)
* 1 potentiometer (analog pin 0)
* 1 Arduino UNO
* 1 PCB (from Seeed ARDX kit)
* A bunch of cables
* 13(ish) 560 ohm resistors

Maybe someday I'll write a tutorial for it
